# Literature notes

I use this as a dumping ground for notes from various projects. Notes are roughly arranged into particular categories, divided across files. Within each file, notes are arranged alphabetically by the first author's name. 

Feel free to add or expand these notes. 

If you have any thoughts or questions, please email me at dakota.s.murray@gmail.com
