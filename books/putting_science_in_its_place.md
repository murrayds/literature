#### Key Concepts
----


1. **Placeless Science:** This is the idea that science is transcendent, disembodied, and not ties to any individual place. Basically, the belief that science is objective and based solely on nature, and not on the local or particularistic circumstances. 
2. **Space:** Livingstone coneptualizes space not as some static or immoble location, but instead as something more mobile, mutable, and abstract. A laboratory would clearly be a space, but so too would a "ship", though it moves between locations and contexts. Space can also inlcude the social, intellectual, cultural, and historical contexts that we move through. 
3. ***in genius loci:*** Roughly translates to the "retional psychology" of a particular places. Livingstone uses this refer to characteristics of people and culture that vary between regions, such as their traditions of thought, channels of intellectual exchane, lingusitic heritage, educational customs, codes of cultural communication, forms of religious belief, and numerous other constituents of human consciousness. Other characteristics might include patterns of patronage, religious characteristics, social organization, and pedagogic activities.

***What is the main argument of the text?***

Livingsotne argues that geography played a prominent role in the production of scientific knowledge; science, he argues, is a human activity, and human activity must take place somewhere. As such, science is not transcendent or objective, but is entwined in a myriad of local and particularistic conditions. Livingstone provides a wealth of historical evidence to support the localness of the scientific enterprise, discussing how the venues of science were involved in the production of knowledge; how regional differences influenced the development of scientific traditions and applications; and how cultural and social circumstances impacted the flow of knowledge.

In the first part of the book, Livingstone shows how scientists must work in a place, whether that be the laboratory, the museum, the field, the coffeeshop, or even the human body, and shows these places are intimately situated in social and cultural characteristics. In the second part of the book, Livingstone discusses how regional characteristics such as religion, culture, colonial status, and more each influence the kind of science being done and how this science is perceived and applied; in doing this, the author even argues that differences manifest at the level of cities, provinces, and countries. In the last part of the book, it's shown how regional characteristics influence how science disseminates and travels around the world; characteristics such as religion, cultural, and social issues all dictate how and the extent to which science is adopted.

Other particular examples he shows how location influences what kinds of people are allowed to do science, how social conventions impact scientific and scholarly discourse, and the various roles of venues of science, like zoos, gardens, and museums have served in various social contexts. In the end, Livingstone calls for a new geography of science, one that considers what is taken to be knowledge, and where the characteristics of the scientist is considered just as strongly as the science.


***Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported.***

The authors largely supports their argument through illustrative examples. He even claims his boko to be an overview or survey, rather than a deep theoretical analysis.

The first part of the book, that which showcases the venues of science, is largely spent discussing various examples of the first laboratories, museums, zoos, galleries, hospitals, and other sites which were sites of research. Here, he has a great section on credentials and credibility, which he links to issues of gender, class, and race.

In the second chapter, the author turns to more historical examples of how science differed across countries in Europe, giving examples of the institutions that dominated Spain, England, Italy, and France, and the kinds of science and motivations of scientists within each nation; in doing so, he shows that the "European scientific revolution" was not a singular event. He extends this analysis to the level of regions and cities, showing just how heterogeneous science was in the 16th century.

The third chapter turns again to historical example, this time mostly focusing on the "Air Pump" (as in  Shapin & Shafer's book) to discuss how replication came to be a method of scientific circulation, but also a highly local and contextualized process. Later, Livingstone discusses the creation and use of maps, and how the global circulation of maps (and other records) bolsters scientific authority and contributes to the flow of scientific knowledge.


***Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text.***

Livingstone largely draws on historical sources or scholars in order to support his theoretical arguments and evidence. He is a Geographer by training, but also at times draws on seminal works in the history of science or STS, such as those by Michael Polyani or Shapin & Shafer. 


***Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument.***

This book largely draws on historical analysis and examples. Since this is a survey, and not a study, it is difficult to discuss the methodology further. 


***What quotes capture the critical significance of the text?***

1. "The enterprise we casually refer to as "science" embraces a huge range of activities carried out in many venues. IN the miscellaneous spaces, nature has been differently experienced, objects have been differently regarded, claims to knowledge have been adjudicated in different ways. It is only when practices and procedures that are mobilized to generate knowledge are located—sited—that scientific inquiry can be made intelligible as a human undertaking. In important ways, scientific knowledge is always teh product of specific spaces. To claim otherwise is to displace science from the culture it is so profoundly a part" (pg 86)

2. "Science has been, and continues to be, promoted as a universal undertaking untouched by the vicissitudes of the local. Our travels in this chapter, however, have exposed something of the degree to which the scientific endavor has persistently exhibited distinctly regional features. Science has borne the stamp of the regional circumstances within which it has been practiced. At the same time, regional cultures have had a profound influence on the reception of new theoreis and on teh rhetorical stances adopted by the interlocutors in public debates over scientific judgements. All the while, the ideology and practices of sciennce have frequently been dpeloyed in efforts to fashion and fortify identify at state and provincial levels. If we are to make sense of those practices called "science" as a dominent feature of the culture of modernity, then we will have to take with much greater seriousness "the regional geographies of scientific endeavors" (pg 134)

3. "The growth of scientific knowledge has been imtimately bound up with geographical movement. Throughts and theoreis have migrated across the earth. Machines and models have diffused from place to place. Information gathered on distant shores has crossed the oceans in maps and manuals....The irreducible reality of space, and the circulation in the growth of science, is thus a. potent reminder that scientific knowledge in an inescapebly social phenomenon involving judgements about the integrity of people and their practices. Geography makes the scientific enterprise an inescapebly moral undertaking." (pg 178)
