#### Key Concepts
----

1. **The Dissenter:** A persona used to aid in the following of scientists and he understanding of scientist-in-the-making. Basically, the dissenter is the person who always dissents and always raises questions and ignites controversy. As such, the scientist is always trying to accumulate allies in order to respond to this dissenter

2. **Black box:** A concept borrowed from Cybernetics; originally, a complicated system in cybernetics was encircled with a black box and simply referred to using its inputs and outputs. Latour uses this idea to refer facts—the goal of science is to produce a black box, a fact or concept which holds and can move between communities and around the world each person interacting with it without having to be concerned about how it was made. Controversies force the black box to “open”, to see the various facets that lead to its making. 


3. **Two-faced/Janus:** Latour uses this idea of the two-faced Janus of science, an old and a new face. The idea is that the faces “speak’ at the same time. The old face speaks the “public” voice of science, and claims that science is a direct representation of nature. The young face, however, instead speaks of the social factors underlying the creation of facts. 

4. **Modality:** A sentence which modifies (or qualifies) another. Positive modalities are those sentences that lead a sentence away from its conditions of production (i.e.: towards objectivity), making it more solid. Negative modalities are those sentences that lead a statement towards the conditions of its production (i.e., towards subjectivity, away from objectivity). Negative modalities explain in detail why the statement is strong or weak. 

5. **Laboratory:** Here, Latour takes a very constructivist view of a laboratory, and calls it simply the place where scientists work. All else being equal, the “power” of a laboratory is proportional to the number of actors employed within. Laboratories are now powerful enough to define reality. 

6. **Instrument:** (or Inscription Device) is any set-up, no matter what its size, nature, or cost, that provides a visual display of any sort in a scientific text. For example an optical telescope, or a far-remote array of radio telescopes. The instrument is what leads to and supports the paper.


#### Questions
----

***What is the main argument of the text?***

Latour models science as some sort of intellectual warfare, where scientists do battle with alliances of actors—both human and non-human. These actors might be lab specimens, students, colleagues, measurement,s equipment, or any other sort of thing. When controversies occur, the scientist who has enrolled the largest and strongest network of actors is the victor. After the controversy is “won” it is closed and becomes a black box. The central idea of the text is that, while science presents a “ready-made” face to the world, one in which science is simply a description of nature, science-in-the-making instead shows a much more social and political process. 

The “principals” stated throughout give another good idea of the main arguments of the text, shown in the appendix. A summary of other main points is given below

- The production of knowledge is a social and collective act, comprised on many actors, both human and non-human
- Scientists and engineers enroll these “actors” to settle a controversy. The scientists who have the most and the strongest actors tend to be the ones whose ideas become truth. There are many strategies for enrolling actors and keeping them in line.
- When examining the development of a scientific controversy, we should never look towards “Nature” as what resolves it. We also should not look only to the “social”. Neither of these, in and of themselves, are sufficient—they only explain settled controversies
- Extending this, “STS” as a discipline cannot treat “Science”, “Technology”, and “Society” as three different spheres—they are all part of the same process and should be considered only symmetrically. 
- Black boxes are what are created by scientists and engineers. These boxes are an assemblage of actors that can be adopted and used without “opening it” and peering into the associations that form it. It does a thing, the details are no longer important. Black boxes are created through a process of many parties enrolling actors and settling controversies.
- There exists a “diffusion” model, which roughly believes that ideas and objects pass through society almost effortlessly, and any resistance is marked as being “social factors”. Latour roughly argues that this idea (a) is necessary for the true existence of STS (separate spheres), and (b) is stupid. 
- The history of technoscience is in a large part the history of all the little inventions made along the networks to accelerate the mobility of traces, or to enhance their faithfulness, combination, and cohesion, so as to make action at a distance possible. 


***Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported.***

Latour supports his arguments through a mix of rhetoric with case studies (usually narratives of individuals) thrown in to give structure and bolster key points. 

- In the second chapter Literature, Latour uses various texts from papers and elsewhere to format his argument. He quotes different sentences in order to express what sorts of claims they make, who makes them, how they modify previous statements, and the strategies encompassed within them. 
 
- In later chapters, Latour typically follows the narratives of a variety of scientists and engineers through the development of, among other things, the diesel engine, the kodak camera, and a model for amino acids. Latour’s arguments are typically crafted around these narratives, with stories and examples given which help to support his theoretical arguments or to highlight his analyticsl method

- Latour also uses an interesting rhetorical device throughout his text, one which he uses to frame his methodology and “push” his narrative towards his own arguments. This device is that of the “visitor” or the relentless “dissenter”. By following this character, Latour is able to abstractly follow a controversy, calling on the dissenter to always push the controversy forward until Latour can reach the end of his theoretical framework. 


***Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text.***

- This text draws upon a rather small scope of literature. His notes and references span only a couple of pages. Typically, he draws on some previous STS literature and ideas, such as Bloor and Bjiker, as well as some history. However, the bulk of his argument is from primary sources, or else he cites scientific literature as a primary source. 
- This book, however, is very clear in what it contributes to. It contributes to the broader STS literature, including also sociology of science, bibliometrics (loosely), and cultural anthropology (as a methodological tool for studying scientists). Basically, it is intended for anyone hoping to study scientists and engineers. This book seems to be one of the methodological pieces that will later come to constitute Actor-Network Theory. 


***Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument.***

The primary methodology is actually Latour’s own methodology. Those rules of methodology that Latour uses throughout are actually the basis which he uses to explore each of the case studies in the book. However, rather than follow a case study fully, he instead uses the “dissenter” character to push narratives forward so that he can reach all the relevant points of his methodology. So when following a case study that has served the narrative well but suddenly stalls, Latour will call upon the dissenter to push the controversy forward so that he can reach the next part of the case study, or else he can speak of it abstractly. 


***What quotes capture the critical significance of the text?***

1. *“The fate of what we say and make is in later user’s hands”* (pg 29)
2. *"Nature is never used as the final arbiter since no one knows what she is and says. But once the controversy is settled, Nature  is the ultimate referee”* (pg 97)
3. *“Confronted with a black box, we take a series of decisions. Do we take it up? Do we reject it? Do we reopen it? Do we let it drop through lack of interest? Do we make it more solid by grasping it without any further discussion? Do we transform it beyond recognition> This is what happens to others’ statements, in our hands, and what happens to our statements in others’ hands. To sum up, the construction of facts and machines is a collective process (this is a statement I expect you to believe; its fate is in your hands like that of any other statements.) This is so essential for the continuation of our travel through technoscience that I will call it our first principal.”* (pg 29)
4. *“Although it sounds counterintuitive at first, the more technical and specialized a literature is, the more ‘social’ it becomes, since the number of associations necessary to drive readers out and force them into accepting a claim as a fact increase.[...]THe distinction between the technical literature and the rest is not a natural boundary; it is a border created by the disproportionate amount of linkages, resources and allies locally available. The literature is so hard to read and analyze not because it escapes from all normal social links, but because it is more social than so-called normal social ties”* (pg 62)
5. *“It is now understandable why, since the beginning of this book, no distinction has been made between what is called a 'scientific' fact and what is called a "'technical' object or artefact. This division, although traditional and convenient, artificially cuts through the question of how to ally oneself to resist controversies. The problem of the builder of 'fact' is the same as that of the builder of' objects': how to convince others, how to control their behaviour, how to gather sufficient resources in one place, how to have the claim or the object spread out in time and space. In both cases, it is others who have the power to transform the claim or the object into a durable whole. Indeed, as we saw previously (Chapter 2) each time a fact starts to be undisputed it is fed back to the other laboratories as fast as possible. But the only way for new undisputed facts to be fed-back, the only way for a whole stable field of science to be mobilized in other fields, is for it to be turned into an automaton, a machine, one more piece of equipment in a lab, another black box. Technics and sciences are so much the same phenomenon that I was right to use the same term black box, even loosely, to designate their outcome.”* (pg 131)
6. *“From the beginning of this book I have constantly presented scientists and engineers as mobilising large numbers of allies, evaluating their relative strength, reversing the balance of forces, trying our weak and strong associations, tying together facts and mechanisms….the equations produced at the final edge of capitalization constitute, literally, the sum of all these mobilisations, evaluations, tests, and ties. They tell us what is associated with what; they define the nature of the relation; finally, they often express a measure of resistance of each association to disruption”* (pg 240)


#### Relevance to my research
----

This is a seminal work to STS, and makes several key contributions to the field

- The deconstruction of the “science”, “technology’ and “society” in STS, and the argument that they must be studied symmetrically.
- The focus on Methodology and principles for use in the study of scientists and engineers
- The introduction of principles that would later becomes ANT, a pretty central theory, at least historically, to STS. He says that we should “”consider symmetrically the efforts to enroll human and non-human resources”; 
- Bringing to light the other people involved in the making of science. The scientist is not alone—they are aided by a network of students, colleagues, technicians, directors, administrators, and more—all playing key roles in the creation of knowledge. 

Generally, this book highlghts the social factors in the creation of scientific knowledge, a key concept for my research.

The discussion of literature, in chapter 2, is especially useful for my work in full text. I can see applications of Latour's definintion of "modality" to my own research work.
